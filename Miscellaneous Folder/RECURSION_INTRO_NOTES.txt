many algorithm techniques are based on recursion like the first step in Dynamic Programing is to write a recursive solution. Similarly, recursion is used in other techniques like Divide and Conquer and Backtracking. Since, a program which can be solved recursively can be solved iteratively but some problems inherently recursive like Tower of Hanoi and DFS based traversals. Searching for a file in Computer is an example of DFS based traversals.
